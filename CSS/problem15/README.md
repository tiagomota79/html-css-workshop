## Description

Create an HTML file and a CSS file that reproduces the following:
![goal](goal.png)

## Reference

Your HTML should have the following structure:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
       <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
   </head>
   <body>
      ...
   </body>
</html>
```

Where style.css is the name of your css file.

Use the poppins font and set the body margin to 0

Use the provided image in the imgs folder

To style your main `<div>` with a background image, you will need to use:

```
background-image: url('imgs/bg.jpg'); /* you need to specify the path to the file */
background-size: cover; /* This ensures the image covers the full space and does not repeat */
```
